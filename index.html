            <h1>Purpose</h1>
            <p>The career path I’m interested in is Programming. The reason for wanting to study in IT is that technology has always been a thing in my life, whether it was in the form of a phone, tv or computer. I’ve played games my whole life and was introduced at a young age, this made me develop this mindset of wanting to know how all these devices are made of the same materials, yet they are all far from the same. This made me slowly want to learn little things like how to take advantage of certain upgrades in peripherals for games like a mouse with a better censor, but also the response on Bluetooth devices. It’s amazing hearing about my grandparents talk about floppy disk and how they hold only 1.44mb, then slowly seeing how we can fit 100tb in the same size that we could fit 2tb. Another example is with pixels on a screen, we have gone from 480p, 720p, 1080p, 2k etc. These little things made me more and more curious for it. The pathway I want to be headed towards is in coding and that could be through software or games.</p>


            <h1>Demonstrating</h1>
            <h2>What will you demonstrate?</h2>
            <p>I have an idea of a career and a pathway but doesn’t mean I only work towards that one. I would love to branch and learn multiple skills for IT so I can use them in my day to day and get better at it. The biggest thing would be catching up and staying up to date on everything. My imagination for ideas and projects is all there, I just lack the skills to take action to turn them into reality!</p>

            <h2>How will you demonstrate it?</h2>
            <p>By learning mainly different types of coding languages and to increase my skills all round. Learning different languages can be hard so the first objective is to mainly focus on just 1 language then branch off into different ones from there, currently I’m learning the basic of programming using python, then I can dabble in java, html etc. My time management and motivation impact my work and how much gets done. I tend to procrastinate and leave things to the last minute so getting ahead on things needs to be my primary goal to saying consistent and staying in a healthy mindset of getting things done on time. I have a broad imagination and I’m sure I can use to at its full capability but learning the skills to do that comes first.</p>

            <h1>Ideal Job</h1>
            <p>My ideal job is to be a software engineer or a games devolper, they both are very similar but so far from close. </p>
            <h2>Software Engineer: </h2>
            <p><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/58554751">Job Link</a></p>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/q0DtB1m.jpg" style="width:200px">
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/R4GEDTb.jpg" style="width:200px">
            <p>
                The position they are offering is to be a software engineer directly with the business. This makes it appealing for me because you get to work with the business directly and if you want workers, you can manage them and their work load. The specifications needed for the job is:</p>
            <br>
        </center>
        <ul>
            <li>CI/CD, BDD, code quality and monitoring</li>
            <li>Python, JavaScript, AWS</li>
            <li>APIs</li>
            <li>SDLC</li>
            <li>Linux, Shell Scripting, load balancing, and basic networking</li>
        </ul>
        <center>
            <br>
            <p>These are a variety of languages in coding that will take time to learn.
                The skills I currently have is junior level in python, this would be an end goal type of job.
                My plan to obtain the skills needed is through learning more in denpth commands through python then branching to different languages like html and java. The biggest thing is dedicating time into learning these different languages since the only way to build and learn of them is through trial and error. Once finishing my quilification for software engineer through uni, I would’ve develop skills needed to progress into more languages and have a general understanding of what’s required.
            </p>
            <h2>Games Developer: </h2>
            <p><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/58339212">Job Link</a></p>

            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/1IGSkjZ.jpg" style="width:200px">

            <p>The position of the job includes working with multiple people all as a team to craft ideas, define and bring clartity to a product. This positon appeals me because it is a end goal when it comes to game development. Working with others with the same mindset as me, and the the fact that you can learn of eachother is a big thing for me. I know teamwork is very important in that aspect since you can build off what others have learnt and ustilise the skills they have acquired through their experiences. The job requires you to have 3 years of experience as a game designer, this is becvasue the games they are working with are rated triple A titles. There are no skills that I have now since this would be an end goal job but learning the skills will come from learning experience and just continueing to better my skills. This job would require a lot of experience with C++ which is more of an advanced language when it comes to games. Learning this I actually have a mentor I can learn with since this is a skill that isn’t very common around programming. Meeting people online has made this easier since it also depends on what they are use to coding that you can learn from.</p>
            <h1>Personal Profile</h1>
            <h2>The Myers Briggs Test</h2>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/SWJUEap.jpg" style="width:600px">
            <p>The test has an interesting analysis on me which I think is cool, obviously since it’s good to see how much they can gain off an answer, but I can agree with these results since I usually am very stubborn that I know what I’m like and this test gives you a different idea to what I would give on myself. I am in fact an introvert BUT I have always been very social online. </p>
            <h2>Learning Style Test</h2>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/NsQklhL.jpg" style="width:600px">
            <p>I couldn’t agree more with these results as I am big visual learner. I think these tests are interesting since it asks a sequence of questions but there is 1 answer you feel strongly about and they calculate it thorugh that. </p>
            <h2>Personality Trait Test </h2>
            <br>
        </center>
        <ul>
            <li>Openness - 73%</li>
            <li>Conscientiousness – 46%</li>
            <li>Extraversion – 40%</li>
            <li>Agreeableness – 83%</li>
            <li>Neuroticism – 50%</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <center>
            <br>
            <h2>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h2>
            <p>In team work generally communication is something that needs to happen aswell as getting along with your team and bonding is also a important. My social skills might not be the best but once I get comfortable with someone its easy to communicate with them. I’d say my personality is a strong factor of how I am in a team, but it’s also influence on how the others are with me. </p>
            <h2>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h2>
            <p>I think it’s best to get to know the others first, I’m not saying i’m not a serious guy when it comes to working, I just like to get along with the people I surround myself with and make sure they feel comfortable so that it doesn’t affect their work either. I like to work in a positive aura since this is what keeps me motivated to continue to put my best into what I do. </p>
            <br>
            <h1>Project Idea</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>My project idea is aimed at artists who like to draw but be able to use that ability on a computer without the use of a mouse The skills to replicate the small micro adjustments as if it was like drawing on a piece of paper and transmitting that to the computer with a program. The use of a touch sensitive pad and a pen will create this feeling. There will be a sequence of items used and data needed. </p>
            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>This project will be useful in many ways to help artists explore options than stuck drawing on a piece of paper. It’s to use IT in a way to help branch artists to use what they’ve learned with the basic and expand their understanding of using different effects and save resources. This will save them more on specific color pallets or pencils since all they would need to do is go to a color sheet and select the exact type of color, they want without paying a single dollar, and it’s not limited use. This develops a artist to put more time into their pieces and if they make a mistake on a piece of paper, it will definitely show since you can’t just undo what you just drew. </p>
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This product will use a touch sensitive pad to transmit what would be drawn down but instead, it will run through a code and give the user the ability to draw on a pc without the use of a mouse and instead a pen. This gives artist the counter to going through stuff like pens and ink when wanting to create art as well as the use to undo and create layers so that their work is separate and can put more time in their work than to utilize the resources. With this project idea it will require a program that can transmute micro adjustments and make it super sensitive, so the user has a precise feel for what they are creating, as if it were a pen on paper. Most talk about towards artist could be the price of resources available to them, some might use spray cans, and some might use Copic markers. They can get pretty cost affective since they are ink and once placed on paper can change a drawing either for the good or for the bad. What if I was to tell you that there could be no bad? Factoring the cost for markers or resources and the mistakes, this project can eliminate those issues for artists. This also could come at the cost of a 10 pack of markers for an unlimited color pallet and resources depending on how much storage you have. Endless area for creation and to make sure artists have the freedom and ability to create anything is the purpose of this project. The aim of this is to help artist feel like they aren’t restricted and give them the ability to explore new options. The pad will be calculated to its borders, The program will let you edit this to fit and specifications the user wants. It will automatically be synced to the resolution of your device. </p>
            <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
            <p>The tools needed is 3d imaging and programming. These skills are the biggest thing involved since it all depends on this build quality of the item and the quality of the code. There will be lots of testing involved to make sure there are no errors 100% but that’s the beauty of this, its to work on not to be completed 100% fully. These will need to be durable and not fragile. The work on the structure and how sleek you can make it depends on the imagination and how much access material you can get rid of, which all factors on how much space you have.</p>
            <h2>Skills Required</h2>
            <p>The skills required is drafting and a programming. The most important part is how stable the program is and how accurate. There will be a high level of skill required to make that happen which makes it a project for a reason. The code language that will most likely be used is C/C++. The skill requirements for the language specifically are high. The material used in this must be durable and will go through testing to make sure it is stable. </p>
            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>This will give artists the ability to convert from paper and pens to digital. This increases their skill and chance to try new things they can’t without technology. The ability to undo is the biggest factor since it gives them more time and chances to do their best without the factor of resources weighing them down. This will keep them more motivated and organized in having less clutter and access everything through 1 software. Some might prefer to still use old methods, but they can still practice on computer then try again on paper. </p>
